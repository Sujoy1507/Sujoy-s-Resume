    <h1>Work Experience</h1>
    <p>
        While I am now focused on building a career in web development, my professional journey began in the field of
        logistics and operations. My past experience has helped me develop strong communication skills, team
        collaboration, discipline, and a professional work ethic â€” all of which continue to support my transition into
        tech.

    <h2>ðŸ“¦ Senior Assistant â€“ Inbound Department</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Company: Flipkart (Narshapura Warehouse, Bengaluru)</li>
        <li>Duration: 7 Months</li>
        <li>Year: â€”
            As a Senior Assistant in Flipkart's Inbound Department, I was responsible for ensuring smooth product
            receiving, sorting, and documentation within the warehouse. My daily duties included:</li>
        <li>Receiving goods from suppliers and verifying them against purchase orders.</li>
        <li>Scanning and labeling items to ensure accurate inventory tracking.</li>
        <li>Maintaining cleanliness and organization of inbound zones for efficiency and safety.</li>
        <li>Collaborating with other departments to reduce delays and improve overall flow.</li>
        <li>Reporting discrepancies and damaged items to supervisors on a daily basis.</li>
    </ul>
    <P>
        This role sharpened my ability to follow structured processes, work under pressure, and maintain accuracy â€”
        qualities that are just as important in web development, especially in coding, debugging, and documentation.
    </P>
    <P>
        Though this job was in a non-technical field, the discipline and attention to detail I practiced there now
        support me in learning programming and building structured web applications.
