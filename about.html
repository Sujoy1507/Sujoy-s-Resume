        Hi, I'm Sujoy Saha — a passionate and self-driven aspiring Web Developer based in West Bengal, India. I’m
        currently on an exciting journey of transforming creative ideas into interactive and user-friendly websites.
        With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I’m steadily building my skills to become a full-stack
        developer.
    </p>

    <p>
        My background in logistics and customer support has shaped me into a problem-solver who values structure,
        deadlines, and clear communication. I believe in writing clean code, learning continuously, and staying curious.
        Every line of code I write brings me one step closer to building something impactful.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I’m not coding, I enjoy experimenting with Bengali-style cooking, watching films, or exploring new tech
        tools that help me grow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let’s connect and build something awesome together.
    </p>
