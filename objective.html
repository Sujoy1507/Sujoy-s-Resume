    <p>
        As a passionate and self-taught web developer, my goal is to grow into a skilled frontend or full-stack
        developer by working on real-world projects that solve real problems. Iâ€™m open to both remote and on-site
        opportunities, where I can apply my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design to build engaging,
        user-focused websites.
    </p>

    <p>
        I believe in clean code, continuous learning, and creative collaboration. Whether it's through internships or
        freelance work, I aim to contribute to impactful digital experiences while expanding my expertise with modern
        tools and technologies.
